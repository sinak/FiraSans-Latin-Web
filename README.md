# FiraSans-Latin-Web

Mozilla's [Fira Sans](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira/) is a beautiful open source font , but the full version contains over 2,000 glyphs and weighs in at 400kB.

This reduced subset includes just the basic latin glyphs, reducing the font size considerably. It also includes woff, woff2, svg, eot, and ttf font files as well as a sample stylesheet for easy use on the web.
