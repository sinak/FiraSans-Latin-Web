# FiraSans-Latin-Web

Mozilla's [Fira Sans](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira/) is a beautiful open source font , but the full version contains over 2,000 glyphs and weighs in at 400kB. This reduced subset includes just the basic latin glyphs, reducing the font size considerably. 

A cross-browser stylesheet is included, and the [fonts](https://github.com/sinak/FiraSans-Latin-Web/tree/master/fonts) folder contains woff, woff2, svg, eot, and ttf font files.
